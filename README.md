workingTitle — Interactive Web Coding Playground

workingTitle is a web-based creative coding playground designed to feel like an old-school desktop OS.
Users can play with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, preview their work live, and explore a preset “community gallery.”

Built for beginners, students, and anyone who wants to sketch ideas in code like it’s a digital art tool.
